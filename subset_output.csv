The apartment has an excellent location. Besides being next to Central Park it is easy walking distance to the subway, the bus lines, and several grocery stores. Their apartment is well kept. The use of the kitchen was a big benefit. The private bedroom had a comfortable bed and a roomy closet. The shared bathroom was never a problem.

32,15164526,120928291,12/12/2016,81171834,Cameron,"A heads up - you probably won't meet Norma, face to face at least. You'll be dealing with her brother Luis, who at times can be a little difficult to get in touch with regarding issues in the apartment. However, to his benefit, he'll be on top of things when you do get a hold of him. Throughout the beginning, there were roaches and they had to send an exterminator out three times before the problem was gone. The rooms are nice, but be aware that there are two other rooms in this apartment that, at any given time, could have other occupants that are not Norma or Luis. If you like privacy, I can't recommend this listing. I think it's quite pricy for what it was, considering the floor layout, but I digress. There are times when Luis will stop by with his kids in tow, who can be quite loud, and he'll be doing things late at night. They were good about taking the trash out, and keeping the area clean. They were also good about checking in to see if everything's ok. The mattresses are comfortable and there is heating available. This room in particular faces a main street, so beware of noise.","probably, norma, luis, little, difficult, touch, however, top, nice, aware, norma, quite, pricy, digress, luis, quite, loud, late, good, trash, also, good, ok, comfortable, available, particular, main"

Location: Super easy walk to nearby places (High Line, Chelsea Market, dining, etc). We only had to take transportation when going uptown to UES/UWS. We walked everywhere and always happened to be super close to “home”.
 
Apartment Size: HUGE!!!! I’ve stayed in my fair share of NY hotels, and this apartment blows hotels to bits. Myself and two girlfriends stayed here (with all our luggage!) and never had any issues with space. The apartment is perfectly furnished with a super comfortable bed in the bedroom and an equally comfortable (really, it is friend approved) pull out sofa. The windows in the apartment are awesome, and we got to enjoy the fall weather with them open the entire weekend. Bathroom is tight, but you have so much room elsewhere to get ready, it worked perfectly for showering. 
 
Host: Erin was an absolute gem. She met us at the apartment with the keys, showed us how to use them and the door opener, and was on her way. She left us a great list of recommendations for the area. She was quick to respond when we had a question about the radiator. She also left us with little ""extras"" around the apartment (razor, lotion, mouthwash). The little touches made the biggest difference. 
 
Overall: I would HIGHLY recommend Erin’s apartment. I can’t wait to get back to NY and stay here again.

Items to note:
- AC only in the Living Room, but there is a fan in the bedroom
- No washer and dryer in apartment or building, but NYC has ample options for laundromats and laundry service
- No gym in building, but the High Line is a little over 2 long blocks away for a scenic early morning walk/run.  Also a Citi Bike station is about 2 short blocks away to go for a bike ride along the Hudson River bike path.
- The public WiFi is from Dunkin Donuts downstairs, so signal strength isn't the strongest (2-3 bars max) in the bedroom; you have to Accept Terms before each use and after every so many hours; and there is bandwidth control, so downloads can take awhile
- Bring your own bath towel as only a hand towel is provided
- Shared bathroom, so it may take some scheduling coordination","periodically, also, short, spacious, highly, excellent, dryer, nyc, laundry, high, little, long, away, scenic, early, also, short, away, bike, path, public, signal, many, awhile"

The location is totally amazing,you have everything you need and you can walk everywhere or take a bike. The pizza restaurant at the corner is so good. 
The room was ok, but the mattresses still has the plastic on so every time you move its create noise. Sleeping was not so good because of that.  The room and the apartment itself were so clean and everything was wonderful if we does not count on the plastic.

The flat is in a brilliant location, extremely close to all the tourist destinations - Times Square, Rockefeller, Empire State, Chelsea and is in a very lively area. The flat itself, including the bathroom, was always extremely clean which is a huge relief when staying at someone's place. Yu was very accommodating and took on board any feedback (I mentioned there wasn't a mirror and didn't expect him to go out and buy one!) and made sure that we were comfortable at all times. Yu was always available and replied promptly if I ever had a message or question.

Later on, even though I was in bed by 10pm, I could hear Yu chatting with the girl who was sleeping in the lounge room and them drinking together.
I was then kept awake from 2 to 4am by Yu cooking dinner loudly (the kitchen is just outside the guest room), eating dinner and then washing up. If that wasn't enough, he proceeded to have a loud phone conversation for half an hour; all outside my door!
Whilst I couldn't work out how he could make so much noise in the kitchen with a guest in the lounge room (which is in an open space alongside the kitchen), it became clear in the morning when I saw the girl guest appearing from Yu's room!
Yu was still asleep when I left the apartment around 10am and I SMS'd him that I have checked out of my room, and had left the bags outside, which I would collect later in the afternoon. He seemed upset that I didn't leave the keys behind for him to give it to another guest!","yu, helpful, later, even, together, awake, loudly, outside, enough, loud, much, open, alongside, clear, girl, still, asleep, bag, outside, later, upset, key, give"

We had a chance to speak the first evening after he came from work. The unit is in a very good location. It was on the 2nd floor, so it was easy getting into and out of the apartment. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed. The bed was OK, but given the price point of the stay, I was willing to deal with it. I given one super thin pillow, not the two shown the photos. I was not given a real blanket to use(certainly not what was shown in the picture), but rather than a thin bed sheet usually put underneath a blanket. I was given a hand towel for my stay, which I found odd. I had to ask for a full sized towel for showering purposes, which Yu provided upon request. It is these little things that I makes me wonder if the host is really considering the comfort of their guests. I worked during the day, so all I care about is resting at night. While I think Yu was super friendly, I would not stay there again due to the inconsistency between the pictures and what I experienced first hand.

But faced little problem with check in timing. Though Yu accepted my early check-in request, he totally forgot about it on the day I moved in. Had to wait for 2.5 hours to get the room ready.

The place is ok for 1 or 2 nights CRASH for those who come into the city for business and nothing more. The room is very small and not comfortable if you move in with large luggages. Laundry is not in house as posted. Someone comes to pick it up from you if contacted through phone by Yu. Room was unbearably hot - no fan or Air conditioning (Air conditioning was in the living room only). WiFi was a shared one from the downstair Cafe's. So had to struggle with the weak signals in both phone and laptop. Was not feeling safe as I had to encounter those weirdos on the door step of the building while entering and exiting. First time in NYC, I didn't feel safe  facing them. I MOVED OUT of the place after coupla nights (yes, risked the loss of my week's payment) to another better Airbnb accommodation in a different and safe neighborhood.
