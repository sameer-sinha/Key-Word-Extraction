# Key-Word-Extraction

Script to extract keywords from the comments on Airbnb reviews file using NLTK module of Python

As the csv file contains more than 600,000 records and I am writing the keywords into csv file, this script takes a long time to run. So, here I have run the script on a subset of the original file.  
Link to original csv file can be found in the text file.

After extracting keywords from reviews, sentiment analyasis can be easily carried with __bag of words__ having relevant and smaller words.
