15194207,110160915,10/24/2016,72717835,Robert,"Kryshana and Mike were excellent hosts. They are both very friendly and helpful. She met us on the street the day we arrived to welcome us. The apartment has an excellent location. Besides being next to Central Park it is easy walking distance to the subway, the bus lines, and several grocery stores. Their apartment is well kept. The use of the kitchen was a big benefit. The private bedroom had a comfortable bed and a roomy closet. The shared bathroom was never a problem. I highly recommend their place."
15194207,111917777,11/2/2016,75064079,Poncho,Exactamente lo que se ve en el anuncio todo en buenas condiciones y excelente atención. Casi no vimos a Kryshana y Mike porque no pasan mucho tiempo en cada. Todo excelente. 
15194207,112787263,11/7/2016,21868136,Marlowe,"Kryshana and Michael  were very hospitable. Their apartment was in a good location, well kept, and picturesque in the sunlight. The 2/3 subway stop is 2 blocks away and take you downtown.  Morningside Park, Central Park, Cathedral of St. John, and Amy Ruth's are all an easy walk within the neighborhood.  I'm a dog person but her cat is cool. To Kryshana and Mike, thanks again.  Monopoly and Westworld night was awesome!"
15194207,113933558,11/14/2016,33066018,Lara,"Kryshana and Mike are very nice.. 
the apartment is clean and it's location is quiet good since the subway is just 2 blocks away ( 4 mins walk)... "
15194207,115697013,11/26/2016,103754823,Xuanzi,Kryshana is really nice and always answered our questions quickly.  We spend a good time at her place. 
15194207,117028082,12/4/2016,30582850,Dawn,"We loved staying here.  Kryshana and Michael were very welcoming hosts, friendly, and helpful. The bedroom was large and clean.  The bed was very comfortable.  A roomy apartment for NY, you didn't feel cramped.  The building also had an elevator which was very welcomed at the end of the day after hiking around the city.  Location is great, 1 block from central park, a subway station 1 block in either direction.  We had a car and were able to park right in front of the building.  Hoping we can stay here again in May when we return."
15194207,120192784,12/8/2016,71753919,Aveet,"Kryshana and Mike were very cool, friendly, nice people. Location is close to transit so easy to get into midtown by train. Their place was clean and equipped with items. They were flexible with check in and check out times which was helpful. They do have a cat but stayed in their rooms so no problems. We had the separate room and living room sofa bed so never felt crowded. Overall, was good and would recommend to others who want to be within short transit ride into mid Manhattan and who are planning on exploring the city for the majority of the stay. Great hosts!"
15194207,121030781,12/13/2016,43723110,Richard,Very accommodating and sweet couple. 
15194207,123503686,12/29/2016,4588221,Antoine,Michael was welcoming - a good communication and a vast comfortable apartment. Recommended if you want to spend time in Harlem and Central Park.
15194207,124313295,1/1/2017,31400499,Alberto,"Complessivamente il soggiorno è andato bene. Kryshana e il suo ragazzo sono stati molto disponibili. Tuttavia il bagno non era molto pulito, non era presente l'asciugacapelli (diversamente da quanto specificato nell'annuncio) e non eravamo stati informati in anticipo circa la presenza di un gatto nell'appartamento."
15194207,126289669,1/10/2017,107884925,Werner,"Kryshana and Mike were very accommodating hosts, and made us feel welcome from the get go. The fact that their home is only 2 blocks away from the subway was also very convenient."
15194207,127027300,1/15/2017,30835982,Hubert,"Amazing!! The emplacement is super convenient, the price dead cheap compared to what I saw, and the two hosts very very nice. They waited for me until 1am because my flight was delayed, they're not intrusive and always happy to talk or give advices. The room is quite big for NYC and includes everything you may need."
15194207,129799441,2/2/2017,6744365,Lula,"Great spot! The apartment has everything you need and Kryshana and Mike made everything super easy. Great communication, and a beautiful location close to Central Park and just a couple short blocks from the subway. I can highly recommend this place!"
883900,105957557,10/3/2016,97323858,Jean,"Only issue was getting there initially, exact address wasn't available on the website/app after confirmation. Made getting there a little tricky. Otherwise was very accommodating. "
883900,124708553,1/2/2017,108296629,Tim,"Safe area and Conformable accommodations. About 1.5 from Manhattan on bus/subway for cheap commute. Otherwise light rail is about 10 bucks and takes abiut 30 mins to get to Penn Station. A bit far from Manhattan, but manageable!"
14935734,104956642,9/29/2016,95421242,Almog,"Overall I had a very positive experience. The flat is quiet as advertised, and within walking distance to most of the things I needed. The only issue is that it's on the last storey in a building without a lift."
14935734,105656077,10/2/2016,95876262,Stuart,Great location. Very close to Columbia university. Easy to find and safe location. 
14935734,106174235,10/4/2016,95036205,Emma,"John’s apartment is clean and neat. Both bathroom and bedroom were as shown as in pictures. I could sleep very peacefully at his place. John was a warming, courteous, and extremely helpful host. He helped me with next days' plan, and his suggestions were quite useful. Will definitely come back! "
14935734,106187823,10/4/2016,91041657,Samantha,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14935734,107173392,10/9/2016,53902054,Maria,"Stayed at Johns place for a weekend with my friend. John is a great host, very helpful and made us feel comfortable in his apartment. The apartment is very cozy and clean. It was a very nice stay. Also good subway connection nearby. Would recommend you to book it right away!"
14935734,107481241,10/10/2016,13237638,Yemu,"John has been a fantastic host. He is super friendly, helpful and kind. He really made me feel at home.

My stay at John's place was a BLAST. The apartment totally exceeded my expectations. It was quiet, clean, cozy and located at a very safe neighborhood in Manhattan. Everything's within walking distance - Columbia University, grocery stores, beautiful parks, major subway stations and movie theaters. 

I would recommend John's place to EVERYONE coming to NYC, and I'd definitely come back and stay at his place again. "
14935734,107801174,10/12/2016,8478095,David,"As advertised, clean and quiet, perfect for my needs, couldn't have been happier"
14935734,108814536,10/17/2016,17420552,Luisa,"I spent a few days with my daughter. John was very helpful before and during my stay. He gave me direction to the apartment, suggestions for dining and transportation. The apartment is very cosy and clean and very conveniently located. I would strongly recommend it for a short stay in New York City."
14935734,109130166,10/19/2016,19096985,Jarvey,"John 是个很好的人,和他聊天很愉快"
14935734,110475735,10/26/2016,8918622,Katalin,John was a very kind host. Everythig was as written in description and we were also respecting it. We loved the location in Harlem and the possibility to reach quickly the subway. We can highly reccommend to stay at John's place. 
14935734,111540847,10/31/2016,94668418,Lian,"nice and tidy room.  convenience for transportation. 

John is on his business trip when we stay in his home.

His girlfriend greets us and everything arranges well.

price is responsible of the location in New York. 

Thanks"
14935734,112766222,11/7/2016,32633539,Rafael,"John was the perfect host with a clean, quiet, friendly place uptown that boasts plenty of neighborhood charm to boot. Would recommend to anyone. "
14935734,125025899,1/3/2017,92021879,Tobias,John's place is great. He allowed us to check-in very late due to our late flight and helped us with the luggage. Most of the time we even had the place for ourself. It is close to the metro with which you are fast in lower Manhattan.
15164526,104438566,9/26/2016,39076885,Don,"Very clean and comfortable. great food nearby, subway within 2 min walking."
15164526,107153278,10/9/2016,96468056,Juanita,"Clean, recently renovated apartment close to subway station. However the host resides elsewhere whom we didn't meet. The 3 rooms are rented independently. Only one bathroom for up to 6 people so that when the shower is in use, the toilet is unavailable."
15164526,110957292,10/29/2016,12625829,Sung Ho,This room is nice place for my vacation. Room is spacious and clean. 
15164526,120928291,12/12/2016,81171834,Cameron,"A heads up - you probably won't meet Norma, face to face at least. You'll be dealing with her brother Luis, who at times can be a little difficult to get in touch with regarding issues in the apartment. However, to his benefit, he'll be on top of things when you do get a hold of him. Throughout the beginning, there were roaches and they had to send an exterminator out three times before the problem was gone. The rooms are nice, but be aware that there are two other rooms in this apartment that, at any given time, could have other occupants that are not Norma or Luis. If you like privacy, I can't recommend this listing. I think it's quite pricy for what it was, considering the floor layout, but I digress. There are times when Luis will stop by with his kids in tow, who can be quite loud, and he'll be doing things late at night. They were good about taking the trash out, and keeping the area clean. They were also good about checking in to see if everything's ok. The mattresses are comfortable and there is heating available. This room in particular faces a main street, so beware of noise."
15164526,124999157,1/3/2017,104835384,Xiangting,"房东第一天电话联系态度极差… 两女生第一次来纽约,一间屋子三个卧室,一个厕所,有男有女,都不认识. 然而房间门上不了锁,是坏的...打电话问可否处理一下,房东很凶,说没人会把你们怎么样的,你们应该放轻松.... 好像叫我们应该怎么做人一样的语气. 作为顾客不是来受气的,房东没有第一时间说解决方案和给予道歉…反而最后是顾客妥协... 最后 五天下来房间门还是坏的. 庆幸遇见的住客都很友善,但不一定都会有这么好的运气... 房东叫人来修,结果也只是塞了软胶垫随便处理了一下,根本锁不上... 总的来说房东很不真诚,不会再选此房源,也不建议. 特别是女生! 态度决定一切..."
7664262,47784269,9/21/2015,30715482,Earl,"The host met us upon arrival to familiarize us with the apartment, and made us feel very welcome.  The apartment is comfortable, clean and quiet.  The bedroom is spacious, with a very comfortable bed.  The sofa bed in the living room is also comfortable.  The building entrance, and the neighborhood are nice/feel very safe.  We were there for work, and found it easy to get to what we needed as far as public transportation, good local restaurants, groceries. "
7664262,51299970,10/19/2015,43169273,Naisha,"Erin’s place is absolutely perfect!! Not only is she an awesome host, her place was perfect for our girls’ weekend trip. 
 
Location: Super easy walk to nearby places (High Line, Chelsea Market, dining, etc). We only had to take transportation when going uptown to UES/UWS. We walked everywhere and always happened to be super close to “home”.
 
Apartment Size: HUGE!!!! I’ve stayed in my fair share of NY hotels, and this apartment blows hotels to bits. Myself and two girlfriends stayed here (with all our luggage!) and never had any issues with space. The apartment is perfectly furnished with a super comfortable bed in the bedroom and an equally comfortable (really, it is friend approved) pull out sofa. The windows in the apartment are awesome, and we got to enjoy the fall weather with them open the entire weekend. Bathroom is tight, but you have so much room elsewhere to get ready, it worked perfectly for showering. 
 
Host: Erin was an absolute gem. She met us at the apartment with the keys, showed us how to use them and the door opener, and was on her way. She left us a great list of recommendations for the area. She was quick to respond when we had a question about the radiator. She also left us with little ""extras"" around the apartment (razor, lotion, mouthwash). The little touches made the biggest difference. 
 
Overall: I would HIGHLY recommend Erin’s apartment. I can’t wait to get back to NY and stay here again. "
10001286,85685542,7/12/2016,47148116,Marco,"Perfect location in down town Manhattan, cozy, clean, bright and very nice view apartment. The host Paul is a kind and generous guy, well prepared everything we need before we arrive. My family and I had a great time staying in Paul's apartment. I definitely will come back again. Thanks Paul~"
10001286,87685789,7/21/2016,26596651,Michaela,"Best appartement ever. Amazing view, so many subway stations right in front of it, the neighbourhood is full with restaurants/take-outs and the Brooklyn Bridge is right around the corner. (So if you are struggling with Jetlag like we did, you can see amazing sunrises up there.)
Couldn't have find a better place. <3
Communication was very uncomplicated. "
10001286,91827025,8/6/2016,67916593,Deedee,"Paul's apt was in great location within all basic need in walking distance, including multiple subway stations, restaurants, grocery, clothing stores, and 24hrs pharmacy. Paul was always very responsive, polite, and well prepared for enough sheets and all necessary amenities that were enough for settling. The apartment was bright, clean, and as described. Kitchen was neat. Kids enjoyed toys and books on his shelve. We had a comfortable and great time there."
10001286,99829146,9/6/2016,32476089,Roberta,"Quartiere molto interessante, a pochi passi da numerose attrazioni e dalle principali linee della metropolitana.
Appartamento molto piu'spazioso e luminoso rispetto alle foto.
Una vista fantastica sui grattacieli con tramonti meravigliosi
Dotato di tutti i comfort, cucina spaziosa ed attrezzata, molti giocattoli per bambini
Unico neo la mancanza della tv e migliorabile la pulizia all'arrivo
Paul molto gentile e disponibile consentendoci anche un comodo check out pomeridiano
Consigliamo sicuramente questo appartamento"
10001286,109120088,10/19/2016,974969,Rick,"Fantastic apartment in a great location.  Clean, roomy, and close to all of tha subway lines.  Paul was easy to communicate with and very flexible.  Perfect experience."
10001286,111259539,10/30/2016,23536507,Sandra,Paul's apartment was perfect for us (family with 2 kids of 13 and 11 years old). The oldest slept in the livingroom on the sofabed. Paul's bedroom is quite spacious and he has a comfortable bed. His kitchen is large and well-equipped. The building is historical. The views (both the freedom tower and empire state building) are stunning. There is no tv and we haven't missed that. WiFi connection is good and there is a sonos system for music. Paul was very responsive to our questions. 
6993502,40415552,7/30/2015,37950084,Jeanette,"Yu is an amazing kind host!! Always very attentive to any of my needs and making sure I felt comfortable. It was a very easy stay! 
The location is great for anyone that wants to be in manhattan and have proximity to everything!
I would REALLY recommend staying here the size of the room is also perfect it is hard to find rooms this big in new york! 
Thank you Yu! it was great staying here keep in touch :) "
6993502,40549118,7/31/2015,37950084,Jeanette,"I loved staying here! The location is perfect since it is in the middle of manhattan really close to everything. The room is great big clean comfortable and nice bed. Yu was an amazing host a true gentlemen always very kind and attentive to my needs. There is a nice pub and dunking donuts downstairs, also a pret and juicery a block down. "
6993502,40877880,8/2/2015,24377245,Ryan,"5 stars for the incredible location. Right outside Penn Station, walking distance to tons of interesting touristy stuff.
5 stars for his hospitality and helpfulness. Very nice host.
3 stars for accomodations. Didn't have guest towel or toiletries, no WiFi. Very clean place.
Overall a great experience. Would stay there again."
6993502,41556592,8/7/2015,30912079,Jiayin,The location is great! It is close to everything! And the room is super clean! 
6993502,41556620,8/7/2015,40538862,Jordan,"Exactly what I needed! I was in NYC for one night and only needed a place to sleep that was convenient to Penn Station. This place is a very short walk from the station and near great shopping and Koreatown, my favorite place to go in NYC. Yu was very quick to respond to my request and questions and the room was clean and nice. The apartment was surprisingly quiet for being in a busy area. I couldn't hear any outside noise or even neighbors. The bed was comfortable and the shower is awesome. Yu was very welcoming and professional getting me settled in. I would absolutely stay here again."
6993502,41897071,8/9/2015,23867158,Brooke,Had a great stay! Everything was as described and Yu was a great host Very well located as well. Highly recommend.
6993502,42364345,8/12/2015,13078200,Sharon,"I was only there a short time but everything was as described. Perfect spot for exploring New York and yes, being close to everything. Place was clean and everything you need is there! Yu was helpful and polite, with good communication. I recommend!"
6993502,42970581,8/16/2015,21367988,Roland,Yu was very hospitable and very friendly. His place was a couple blocks away from Madison Square Garden which was very convenient.  It is close to everything!  I would definitely stay there again.
6993502,44506346,8/26/2015,39147880,Madelaine,"Yu was very friendly and made my stay easy. His place is super clean!
the wifi was not 100% but generally worked.
I would definitely go back."
6993502,46407686,9/10/2015,27802665,Christy Joy,"Yu is prompt with replies and will check in periodically to ensure you're enjoying your stay.  He was also accommodating with check in and check out times.

The apartment's location is convenient!  Subways, stores, restaurants, and bars can all be accessed within 1-4 short blocks.  The bedroom itself is very spacious.  Highly recommend for minimalists that just need a shower and bed for an excellent value.

Items to note:
- AC only in the Living Room, but there is a fan in the bedroom
- No washer and dryer in apartment or building, but NYC has ample options for laundromats and laundry service
- No gym in building, but the High Line is a little over 2 long blocks away for a scenic early morning walk/run.  Also a Citi Bike station is about 2 short blocks away to go for a bike ride along the Hudson River bike path.
- The public WiFi is from Dunkin Donuts downstairs, so signal strength isn't the strongest (2-3 bars max) in the bedroom; you have to Accept Terms before each use and after every so many hours; and there is bandwidth control, so downloads can take awhile
- Bring your own bath towel as only a hand towel is provided
- Shared bathroom, so it may take some scheduling coordination"
6993502,47177172,9/16/2015,41321404,Jin,"Positive points:
1)great location. 2)clean APT, hardwood. 3)gentle & nice host.

Negative points:
1)small place, Manhattan size. 2)weak WiFi, have to use down stair store one."
6993502,47327254,9/17/2015,17598541,Robert,"Yu was helpful from the start. While his previous guest was still in the process of checking out, he let me leave my bag to lighten my load while I ran my trips around town. 

The location was exactly as described. I was there for a concert & Madison Square Garden was extremely close (1 min walk).

The room was just as described, clean and prepared for check-in with no delay. Yu's place is just what you need to get in, sleep on a comfy bed & be on your way.

I definitely give Yu's place the highest recommendation & would stay there again."
6993502,47423914,9/18/2015,11197310,Calvin,"Great location, within walking distance to Penn Station. Perfect for a no-frills overnight stay. Very accomodating of Yu to let us leave our luggage there in the early hours before check-in."

6993502,48455721,9/26/2015,44297761,Vincent,"Yu is very friendly and helpful. The location is very good, located very closed to Penn Station and subways. The bedroom and bathroom is pretty clean.  Though the shower is pretty weak. It is a 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom, 1 small kitchen and one living room studio.  Even though Yu is staying in the other room, but I feel I still have some privacy. Overall, it is pretty good. "
6993502,48730639,9/28/2015,5705314,Luisa,"My husband and I spent the weekend at Yu's apartment. He left us to drop our bags off so early in the morning,and we really appreciate it. The location is totally amazing,you have everything you need and you can walk everywhere or take a bike. The pizza restaurant at the corner is so good. 
The room was ok, but the mattresses still has the plastic on so every time you move its create noise. Sleeping was not so good because of that.  The room and the apartment itself were so clean and everything was wonderful if we does not count on the plastic.

Thanks Yu"
6993502,49141048,10/1/2015,3022424,Sonia,"Large and very clean room in a tidy apartment. I mainly booked this room because I would arrive in Penn Station and wanted to drop my bag  nearby. Communication with Yu Jen was easy and he meet me in the apartment on the time of my arrival.
Surprisingly not very noisy at all.
I would recommend staying at Yu Jen's."
6993502,49392650,10/3/2015,43504588,Mina,"Yu was a brilliant host and made myself and my friend feel welcome as soon as we arrived at his flat. The flat is in a brilliant location, extremely close to all the tourist destinations - Times Square, Rockefeller, Empire State, Chelsea and is in a very lively area. The flat itself, including the bathroom, was always extremely clean which is a huge relief when staying at someone's place. Yu was very accommodating and took on board any feedback (I mentioned there wasn't a mirror and didn't expect him to go out and buy one!) and made sure that we were comfortable at all times. Yu was always available and replied promptly if I ever had a message or question. I would absolutely recommend staying at his flat - you won't regret it."
6993502,50006051,10/8/2015,3523762,Felicia,Very strategic location!!! Yu is very kind;)
6993502,50493724,10/12/2015,5095823,L.,"Yu was great! The room was super private and very clean, and his place is really close to city center but not smack dab in the middle of everything, so there isn't a lot of noise at night. He also reached out a few times to make sure I didn't need anything.

Overall, a wonderful experience!"
6993502,51156719,10/18/2015,19442545,Francesca,"Yu is a really careful host, nice and easygoing, he even helped me with me with the lagguage. 
The room and the apartment are really clean, quite and comfortable; the location is just perfect.
I absolutely recommend staying at Yu's :)"
6993502,51512396,10/20/2015,46487022,Lola,Yu was a great a host. Couldn't ask for a better experience. The location is central and close enough to everything. The apartment was super clean and room was private. Yu was always a text away if I had any questions. Would definitely stay again!
6993502,52015685,10/25/2015,46982058,Lujun,great location! clean apartment! and really nice host! I'll definitely choose to stay here if I come to NYC again
6993502,53054079,11/4/2015,8676278,Veronica,"I found Yu to be a friendly, easy going host.  Communication via phone/airbnb message was easy.
The location is perfect for a visit to New York, about 100 metres to Penn Station and Madison Square Garden, easy walk to HighLine, Times Square etc.  Being able to tap in to wifi from Dunkin Donuts was a bonus too.
The apartment is very clean and the bedroom is very private.  It is real value for money.  I would certainly visit NY again and be very happy to stay with Yu.  It was an easy going time and was even in walking distance with a massive suitcase to the Port Authority when returning to Newark Airport.
Loved everything about my visit to New York especially the accommodation.  Thanks Yu"
6993502,53446399,11/8/2015,1361687,Hillary,Yu took us in at the last minute. Meeting up to get the key was easy. The apartment was clean and super close to Penn Station. Would recommend a stay here.

6993502,57489495,12/26/2015,28195775,Huazhe,I got good experiences. Perfect location and yu is a nice person.
6993502,57606229,12/27/2015,44582433,Alicia,"Yu's place is a great place to stay in NYC. First of all, it's at a very convenient location. Secondly, the room is bright and clean, it has hangers as well as enough space to store your luggage and bags. The bathroom is very clean and the shower is very nice, just feel at home. Yu is a good host, very easy to communicate and helpful. I enjoyed my one night staying at Yu's place while visiting NYC. "
6993502,59604371,1/12/2016,52577759,Mark,The place is in a great location. You can practically see Times Square when you walk out the front door. Yu was very professional and even provided a towel. The bathroom is very nice and the whole place is very clean. I plan to stay here whenever I am in New York.
6993502,59852937,1/16/2016,3182338,Yana,"Yu is awesome, very helpful and will make sure that you have everything you need during your stay in NYC. Room is clean, bed is comfy, location is super convenient. Will be happy to stay there again my next time."
6993502,60375195,1/22/2016,20408259,Michelle,"Super clean, close to Penn station/subways, easy access to Times square & whatever midtown Manhattan has to offer! "
6993502,60553674,1/24/2016,37813,Nicole,Yu was a fantastic host! I arrived last minute before the blizzard hit NYC and he quickly was able to accommodate me. We had nice conversation when together but we mostly kept to our own bedrooms. He was also flexible to add one more night to my stay!
6993502,61102354,1/31/2016,17705235,Samir,"Yu was helpful in letting me drop off my bags at 11am on a Saturday.
Later on, even though I was in bed by 10pm, I could hear Yu chatting with the girl who was sleeping in the lounge room and them drinking together.
I was then kept awake from 2 to 4am by Yu cooking dinner loudly (the kitchen is just outside the guest room), eating dinner and then washing up. If that wasn't enough, he proceeded to have a loud phone conversation for half an hour; all outside my door!
Whilst I couldn't work out how he could make so much noise in the kitchen with a guest in the lounge room (which is in an open space alongside the kitchen), it became clear in the morning when I saw the girl guest appearing from Yu's room!
Yu was still asleep when I left the apartment around 10am and I SMS'd him that I have checked out of my room, and had left the bags outside, which I would collect later in the afternoon. He seemed upset that I didn't leave the keys behind for him to give it to another guest!"
6993502,61710372,2/7/2016,31780659,Alexandra,"Yu is a very nice host, always ready to help. The place is very clean, exactly as in the pictures. I would be happy to stay there again."
6993502,62643299,2/15/2016,47564711,Olivia,"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Yu was a great host, location was amazing, apartment was very clean and I will definitely stay with Yu every time I come to New York!"
6993502,62947136,2/18/2016,15446063,Jungwon,"It was so good. Yu was friendly and kind. Location is real central of manhattan. Room was very clean. Thank you, Yu.  "
6993502,63243635,2/21/2016,57943444,Felicia,"I had a good stay. Yu's place is very clean and is located in a very convenient location (just a few minutes walk from Penn Station). I'd recommend this place!
"
6993502,63735072,2/26/2016,2738331,Mushfique,Great location. Cool host. Place is clean as advertised. Definitely would be open to staying here again
6993502,65112371,3/10/2016,10857015,Leandro,"Yu's place is very well located, clean and comfortable. "
6993502,65245697,3/12/2016,45329384,Sabine,"Yu's place is in a perfect location, not even 5 minutes away from Penn Station in an area where you can get about anything you need. Yu himself is really nice, friendly and thoughtful! Checking in and out was smooth and easy and the appartment is very clean. I would definitely come back :)"
6993502,65721079,3/16/2016,14371618,Emily,"Yu's place is fantastic. The location is central to everything you might want to do in NYC: close to Times Sq, blocks away from great restaurants and shopping, easy access to subways. The apartment itself is clean, quiet and modern. I was actually out of the apartment for the majority of my trip, but Yu was a great host: always checking in  to see if I needed anything.  I'd def stay here again!"
6993502,66763191,3/24/2016,20842808,Cristina,"It was the first time with Airbnb and Yu has been a very good host. The room was clean as decribed and in a good position because Penn Station is so near. The check-in was easy as the check-out thanks a good communication between guest and host. According to me only the bed was not so confortable and kitchen could be more furneshed for guests, but never mind.
In the end there was only one negative aspect but NOT because of Yu: I don't know why on the ground floor of the apartment building rubbish wasn't taken away for 7days emitting not a good smell. I SUGGEST YU's ACCOMODATION!"
6993502,67210807,3/27/2016,15656521,Carmen,"Yu was a helpful host, and respected the privacy. Location was really good, couldn't ask for more.  "
6993502,68507046,4/5/2016,6812088,Yiu Sum,"The room was clean, and the location was fantastic near the Penn Station. Check-in and check-out was easy, and Yu was very flexible with timings. I had some lock issues and Yu was unavailable via his preferred mode of communication till I called him 5 hours later, which was slightly unfortunate. Remember to test your keys once checking in to ensure he's available. The house is located on the second floor with stairs, and your luggage weight might be a consideration. Overall, recommended for a fuss-free stay and for a great location. "
6993502,69139700,4/9/2016,2870800,Erme,"Yu's apartment has a good location , if you are looking for something fancy this place is not for you, we had a clean place, close to everything in midtown for a 2 days stay ...

Recommended for a short period

Thanks"
6993502,70277234,4/17/2016,25376698,Brandon,This room was very small but my wife and I only needed it add a place to sleep.  We were close to everything and got to see some of the Chelsea area. Yu keeps a very clean apt. My wife arrived a few hours after I did but she never met him.
6993502,71663799,4/27/2016,5423729,Alan,"Yu was very nice and helpful, I didn't see him at all after check-in. The apartment was in a great location "
6993502,74176812,5/13/2016,58047625,Audrey,Appartement très propre et très bien localisé. Yu est très sympa. Il y a tout ce dont on a besoin. C'est calme et central. L'appartement est comme sur les photos. Je recommande! 
6993502,75567943,5/22/2016,27590929,Chao,"The location is impeccable, one block away from Penn Station and subway. The room is clean and minimal, with everything I really need, a bed, a shelf to hang my clothes, a mini table and a garbage bin. Since no shoes are allowed in the apartment, it's pretty clean everywhere. Yu was very friendly and helpful.
It can be noisy at night, it's close to the street, be sure to bring your earplugs. Overall I'm very satisfied with the experience."
6993502,77760402,6/3/2016,52947843,Marion,"Appartement très bien situé pour un premier séjour à New York ! Il correspond à la description : rudimentaire mais propre et calme. Dommage qu'on ne puisse plus cuisiner.
Yu est très sympathique. Nous recommandons!!"
6993502,78883975,6/9/2016,4352455,Justin,Yu was a wonderful host. Apartment was clean and very quiet. I will definitely try to stay here again for future visits
6993502,84920622,7/9/2016,60557906,Buddhi,"Good place, clean room and bathroom. you get good privacy and a private room which you can lock. convenient location, close to the subway, Penn station, supermarkets and other stores.

Only con - The room is a little small.

I would recommend this place."
6993502,94238684,8/15/2016,4040117,Brian,Great! 
6993502,96361985,8/22/2016,47336995,Mario,"Yu was a nice host, he was really nice. He was always taking care of us and ensuring that we were ok.
I recommend him."
6993502,97240381,8/26/2016,1204975,Pierce,"Yu was very nice. He communicated with me the day of and made sure I had no problem accessing to the apartment upon my arrival. We had a chance to speak the first evening after he came from work. The unit is in a very good location. It was on the 2nd floor, so it was easy getting into and out of the apartment. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed. The bed was OK, but given the price point of the stay, I was willing to deal with it. I given one super thin pillow, not the two shown the photos. I was not given a real blanket to use(certainly not what was shown in the picture), but rather than a thin bed sheet usually put underneath a blanket. I was given a hand towel for my stay, which I found odd. I had to ask for a full sized towel for showering purposes, which Yu provided upon request. It is these little things that I makes me wonder if the host is really considering the comfort of their guests. I worked during the day, so all I care about is resting at night. While I think Yu was super friendly, I would not stay there again due to the inconsistency between the pictures and what I experienced first hand. "
6993502,97875819,8/28/2016,15249149,Doug,Convenient and clean. Check-in and check-out were easy.
6993502,99402648,9/4/2016,84608119,Aarthi,"Yu was a very good host. The room and apartment is very clean. very close to Penn station which gives an easy access to all main places and tourist attractions. 

But faced little problem with check in timing. Though Yu accepted my early check-in request, he totally forgot about it on the day I moved in. Had to wait for 2.5 hours to get the room ready.

The place is ok for 1 or 2 nights CRASH for those who come into the city for business and nothing more. The room is very small and not comfortable if you move in with large luggages. Laundry is not in house as posted. Someone comes to pick it up from you if contacted through phone by Yu. Room was unbearably hot - no fan or Air conditioning (Air conditioning was in the living room only). WiFi was a shared one from the downstair Cafe's. So had to struggle with the weak signals in both phone and laptop. Was not feeling safe as I had to encounter those weirdos on the door step of the building while entering and exiting. First time in NYC, I didn't feel safe  facing them. I MOVED OUT of the place after coupla nights (yes, risked the loss of my week's payment) to another better Airbnb accommodation in a different and safe neighborhood. Cooking is not allowed which was mentioned to me after I moved in (Laundry and Kitchen usage mattered to me since I planned to stay here for a week). "
6993502,102538342,9/18/2016,36344675,Christine,"Yu is a nice guy, who responds to your messages. Quiet, helpfull, he respects your space and you can also discuss with him.The photos reflect the location, so I had no bad surprise at my arrival. As I came late in NYC, Yu couldn't be there for the check-in but he find an easy solution. The bathroom is nice. The appartement is perfect localed, nices restaurants and bars around and makes very easy to visit New York. "
